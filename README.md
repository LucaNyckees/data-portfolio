# Data science portfolio

### Description

This project aims at delivering a data science portfolio wrapped as a React app. I took the initiative of realizing a personal website to learn the fundamentals of Web Development with 
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- HTML/CSS
- React

The resulting website is divided into the following sections:
- home section (header, and `js-particles` animation)
- about section (education blocks, compact work experience timeline block, about-me text, profile picture)
- projects portfolio section (a selection of projects divided into two categories : private and public)
- code stack section (a selection of computer skills divided into several categories, such as "Language" or "MLOps")

There is an original component to integrate your technical skills (code stack), do not hesitate to take inspiration from it.

## Instructions

Launch with `npm run dev` to work on it locally. There is no config to setup.

## Snaphost

This is a small video showing an open project page, the projects selection and the code stack cards.
